1.bytecode is nothing but which is codes are in coverted byte format or structure and is converted by jre.
2.features:
object oriented
multithreading
robust
secure
write once run anywhere
3.instanceof
4.yes java is purly object oriented programming language because it uses objects,class
5.no we can't do that
6.there are 4 types in variables in java those are
instance
static
local
parameter
7.its mandatory to specify datatype in java to provide perticular value to variables
8.types of datatypes:
there are 2 types
primitive data type and non primitive datatype
primitive are the predefined datatype which are used to predefine the datatyes
in primitive we have 8 datatypes those are
int 
byte
long
short
float
double
boolean 
char
non primitive are the instance or reference datatype are should be accesed by any reference or instance variables
in non primitive we have string,class,arrays
9.it's error because variables are not decalred or initialized starting with any special characters like *,$,_ etc it should be start with alphabets
10.error because it needs else statement there bo0lean is intialized with true value
11.modulus operators are like % which is used to initializes the string type value like to recognise string with missing character.
12.compilation error
13.All
14.3
15.there are 3 types of loops java has to support
16.jre
17.class default{
		static float value;
		public static void main(String []args){
		System.out.println("float is:"+value+"thank you");
		}
}
18.in java when we declare the variable using static keyword even without initialized compiler will provide default value for that static variable.
19.Wrapper class are having reference datatypes for all primitive data type also by which we can converted one data type to another data type
wrapper classes are:
Integer
Byte
Long
Short
Double
Float
Boolean
Character
